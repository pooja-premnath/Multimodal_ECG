      "{'query': 'What are some features of normal ECG patterns?', 'result': 'Normal ECG patterns typically show a regular rhythm with consistent intervals between heartbeats, appropriate P wave morphology (pointing upwards and inward), PR interval duration within the range of 120-240 milliseconds, QRS complex width less than or equal to 80-120 milliseconds indicating proper ventricular depolarization, ST segment that is on a flat line with respect to baseline (no elevation or depression), and T wave usually upright in most leads but can be inverted in lead III. These patterns reflect normal sinus rhythm and cardiac function without evidence of pathology such as arrhythmias, conduction blocks, ischemia, or myocardial infarction.', 'source_documents': [Document(metadata={'source': 'The-ECG-Made-Easy-9th-Edition.pdf', 'file_path': 'The-ECG-Made-Easy-9th-Edition.pdf', 'page': 208, 'total_pages': 269, 'Author': 'J.Hampton', 'CreationDate': \"D:20190323092533+00'00'\", 'Creator': 'calibre (3.40.1) [https://calibre-ebook.com]', 'ModDate': \"D:20190323142234+03'00'\", 'Producer': 'calibre 3.40.1 [https://calibre-ebook.com]', 'Title': 'The ECG Made Easy E-Book'}, page_content='9\\nECGs you must be able to\\nrecognize\\nECGs with clinical scenarios 164\\nECG descriptions and interpretations 172\\nYou should now be able to recognize the common ECG patterns, and\\nthis final chapter contains twelve 12-lead ECGs for you to interpret.
